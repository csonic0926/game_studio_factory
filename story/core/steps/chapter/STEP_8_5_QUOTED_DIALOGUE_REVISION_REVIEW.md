# STEP 8.5 — Quoted Dialogue Revision Acceptance

## Purpose

Review the saved quoted-dialogue revision and decide whether it passes.

## Read inputs from

- `<STORY_ROOT>/runtime_scene_drafts/<ARTIFACT_STEM>_DIALOGUE_REVISION.md`
- `<STORY_ROOT>/runtime_scene_drafts/<ARTIFACT_STEM>_DIALOGUE_REVISION_FLUENCY.md` — the spoken-fluency log written by the pass that runs between STEP 8 and this gate
- touched chapter-local rows in the runtime timeline and locale files defined by the adapter `LANDING_SPEC.md`
- `<ADAPTER>/GLOSSARY.csv` when present; missing means `NOT_AVAILABLE` and
  glossary-only checks are skipped. When present, it is the sole canonical
  proprietary-term source

## Save output to

- `<STORY_ROOT>/runtime_scene_drafts/<ARTIFACT_STEM>_DIALOGUE_REVISION_REVIEW.md`

## Skill use

- No skill required for this step.

## Task

Check whether the quoted-dialogue revision is complete, speaker-faithful, and safe to hand to final QA.

## Acceptance criteria

### Dialogue scope

This step passes when:

- the revision is limited to quoted dialogue lines, except for minimal adjacent coherence fixes when needed
- the revision log clearly records what changed

### Character voice

This step passes when:

- revised lines sound more like the specific speaker
- spoken lines keep their pragmatic role and scene pressure

### Spoken fluency（唸稿抽查）

This step passes when:

- the spoken-fluency pass ran as its own worker: the fluency log exists at
  `<STORY_ROOT>/runtime_scene_drafts/<ARTIFACT_STEM>_DIALOGUE_REVISION_FLUENCY.md`
  with one original → repaired comparison entry per changed line
- sampling check: pick THREE revised quoted lines (across locales, not
  only `<PRIMARY_LOCALE>`) and read each one aloud. If any line reads as
  design-annotation register — subject or preposition elided past what
  speech allows, modifier clauses stacked before a noun, several
  information foci strung into one sentence, a verb collocation no one
  says — this gate FAILS and routes back to STEP 8. Judge against the
  adapter `STYLE_GUIDE.md` spoken-grammar section when present, else the
  generic rules in `core/craft/spoken-fluency.md`.
- meaning survived the repair: spot-check the log's comparison entries —
  beat, pragmatic function, information content, and character voice are
  unchanged between original and repaired lines

### Structural safety

This step passes when:

- routing is unchanged
- knowledge order is unchanged
- scene meaning is unchanged
- no new contradiction is introduced into the landed chapter

### Chinese adverb restraint（中文副詞節制）

For every revised Chinese quoted line, enforce the STEP 7 rule at 98/100
strength. Fail and route back to STEP 8 when an adverb could be deleted or
recast without materially changing truth, negation, modality, scope,
chronology, causal relation, required degree, an upstream-required voice
marker, or idiomatic Chinese. Emphasis, rhythm, atmosphere, polish, generic
intensification, and habitual hedging are not valid exceptions. Necessary
adverbs remain allowed; do not demand clipped, padded, unidiomatic, or
meaning-changing dialogue.

### Glossary and term nomination

When the glossary exists, run `scripts/glossary_check.py` on the revised
artifact (and its `--locale LOCALE=PATH` mode for aligned JSON catalogs when
applicable). This step passes when exact banned forms are absent, every
applicable protected form that entered the fluency pass survived unchanged,
registered en/ko correspondences are used, and the speaker's variant obeys
`register` / `speaker_scope`.

Checker failures caused by this revision fail the gate. Pre-existing shipped
locale mismatches are recorded and must not be silently attributed to STEP 8.
Synonyms and unregistered terms remain human review: a new world noun,
classifier convention, or register variant requires a `status=pending`
nomination (or an explicit candidate in this review), not an automatic FAIL.
The gate never edits the glossary. Pending → `canon`/`banned` is USER-only;
deprecating canon or changing an existing canon/banned row is also USER-only,
and each decision records `provenance`. Do not mirror the decision into
`WORLD_RULES.md` or use another artifact as a competing term list.

## Required stop condition

- write a short note that says `STEP 8.5 PASS` or `STEP 8.5 FAIL`
- on `FAIL`, state the blocker clearly
