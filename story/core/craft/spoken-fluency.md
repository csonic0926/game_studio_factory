# Craft — spoken-fluency（唸稿潤句）

Repair the sentence grammar of quoted spoken lines — and ONLY the sentence
grammar — so that every line is something a native speaker's mouth can
actually produce. Everything else is frozen: beat structure, pragmatic
function, information content, character voice, canon terms.

Origin: vinci_world dialogue production test (2026-07-13). The USER ruling:

> Story factory 的產出唯一問題就是文句不流暢。就算生成英文的，也是非常
> 古怪的句子。但 beat、情感、身份等等確實是正確的。以語言學的角度講，
> 是文法不對——factory 產出的句子文法是有問題的。

The disease: a worker that has spent its whole context on design reasoning
(beat duties, pragmatic functions, red-line self-checks) carries the
**compressed syntax of design annotation** into the quotation marks —
subjects and prepositions elided to a degree only written notes allow,
relative clauses stacked before nouns, verb collocations that exist in no
one's daily speech. The constraints all land (beat / emotion / identity
correct); the language layer fails because language was never any worker's
sole task.

## Architecture requirement — independent fresh worker

This craft MUST run as its own fresh worker. The worker that created the
lines must never perform this pass on them "while it's at it": the whole
point is that a context contaminated by a day of design reasoning cannot
hear its own annotation register. Same principle as review gates being
independent workers. This pass is a production step (integer-step side),
not a gate: it changes text; gates only judge.

## Input

1. One artifact containing quoted spoken lines. Typical: a CHAPTER STEP 6
   runtime draft, a STEP 8 quoted-dialogue revision (the touched timeline /
   locale rows), or a `dialogue-runway` / `quoted-dialogue` craft output.
   Any artifact with lines inside `「…」` / `"..."` qualifies.
   **Bare-lines rule**: when the artifact wraps its lines in design prose
   (per-line annotations, beat rationale), the caller extracts a bare line
   list — speaker + line + a one-line scene anchor per group — and
   dispatches THAT. The worker must not read the surrounding design
   annotation: a context marinated in annotation register cannot hear
   annotation register. The full artifact stays with the caller for
   merging the repairs back.
2. The adapter `STYLE_GUIDE.md`. If it has a spoken-grammar section (e.g.
   vinci_world §4.1「對白口語文法」), those project rules BIND this pass —
   read that section before touching a line. If the project has no such
   section, the generic rules below apply.
3. From the caller: the output path for the fluency log (see Output).
4. `<ADAPTER>/GLOSSARY.csv`, when available, belongs to the **caller and
   canon-aware back-check**, not to the clean-room worker. The caller extracts
   the current scene language's canon `dialogue_protected=true` forms and
   exact `banned` forms mechanically with
   `scripts/glossary_check.py --glossary <ADAPTER>/GLOSSARY.csv --extract-cleanroom <LOCALE> <artifact>`
   (plus repeated `--speaker` filters when needed). Missing glossary means
   `NOT_AVAILABLE` and preserves the former hand-picked/STYLE_GUIDE behavior.
   When available, the glossary is the sole canonical proprietary-term source;
   no constraint extraction may fall back to `WORLD_RULES.md`, a style/lint
   allowlist, locale prose, or another term list.

## Freeze list (never change)

- beat structure and beat order — no line added, dropped, or reordered
- each line's pragmatic function (ask / warn / refuse / push / …)
- information content — no new reveal, no lost information, no
  strengthened or weakened claim
- character voice markers — sentence-final particles, verbal tics,
  short-vs-long sentence personality contrast, register differences
  between speakers
- glossary-registered canon / red-line wording stays exactly as registered
  when the glossary is available; legacy projects retain their existing
  hand-picked freeze constraints
- when a glossary exists, every applicable canon
  `dialogue_protected=true` form supplied by the caller
- narration outside quotation marks
- in landed runtime files: routing, ids, keys, structure — text values of
  the touched dialogue fields only

**Carve-out — metaphor noun-skeletons are NOT protected.** The
information freeze protects what a line says, not a broken image's
anatomy. Two defects sit on the grammar side of the line and MUST be
acted on: (a) a stranded classifier — a measure word whose noun is
neither said nor recoverable from anything present in the scene; (b) an
image that imposes structure a canon entity does not have (e.g. levels
onto something the world defines as level-less). Repair the skeleton when
the image's job survives the repair; when it cannot (the image itself is
the defect), red-flag the line for the creation side with one line of
diagnosis — never silently keep it because "the metaphor is content".

## Clean-room rewrite mode（淨室重寫）— DEFAULT for draft-stage dialogue (2026-07-17)

Validated by ablation (owner-run experiments 2026-07-14): the register
disease is cured by taking the rewrite OUT of the design context, not by
piling on rules. Zero-shot suffices — the model's native spoken ear does
the work once the context is clean; exemplars demote to taste
calibration; world-model errors stay invisible in the clean room BY
DESIGN and belong to the canon gate. Flow:

1. **Clean-room worker.** Its ENTIRE context is plain-speech material,
   written like a director's note — nothing in design register. It
   contains ONLY: a one-line scene anchor; a one-line persona sketch;
   the draft lines; each line's job as one plain phrase; hard
   constraints as spoken rules (the glossary-derived protected terms,
   frozen lines verbatim, glossary-derived red-line words,
   no-acquisition promises, and for Chinese lines the 98/100-strength rule to
   delete or recast every avoidable adverb while preserving necessary
   negation, modality, scope, chronology, causal relation, degree, idiom, and
   required voice); and any world facts the
   lines touch, one plain line each (facts don't contaminate; register
   does). NO craft docs, NO style guides, NO design artifacts, NO
   exemplar prose, NO file access. The worker rewrites the whole passage
   in one breath（一口氣）— not line-by-line patching — reads it aloud,
   and returns lines only, plus at most two flags.
   - Frozen lines = creative-layer decreed lines AND lines whose current
     text is already an owner repair (those are the script's current
     text, not teaching material).
2. **Canon back-check gate**（canon-aware, separate context）— it reads the
   glossary when available and runs `scripts/glossary_check.py` on the fluent
   artifact (with `--baseline` whenever separate before/after artifacts are
   available). Mechanical diff on the fluent text: protected terms present, frozen
   lines verbatim, red-line words absent, every line's job delivered;
   PLUS the world-model collocation check (imagery imposing structure a
   canon entity does not have — see the freeze-list carve-out). A
   violation bounces back to the clean room with ONE plain line naming
   only the violated constraint. Checking constraints on fluent text is
   cheap and mechanical; checking fluency on constraint-correct text
   needs the owner's ear — this ordering is the whole point.
3. **Owner's ear** — the cut. Owner repairs enter the project exemplar
   library as taste calibration (economy, word preferences), not as
   grammar rescue.

The per-line repair procedure below remains for landed runtime files
(where only the touched dialogue fields may change) and for small
touch-ups where a whole-passage rewrite is disproportionate.

The clean-room worker never reads `GLOSSARY.csv`, a style guide, shipped locale
catalogs, or any design file. The wrapper's extraction and the back-check are
what make glossary discipline mechanical without reintroducing design
register into the language context. Blank locale mappings and newly observed
world terms are reported as pending nominations; no worker may promote them.

## The work (per-line repair mode)

Go line by line through every quoted line, in every locale present.

1. **Read the line aloud（唸稿）.** Actually vocalize it — this is the
   writer's step, not a reviewer courtesy. If it knots, breaks breathing,
   or sounds like reading an annotation, it fails.
2. **Rewrite at sentence granularity.** The minimal unit of repair is the
   sentence, not the word. Patch-editing a broken sentence produces
   another broken sentence: split it, restore what speech needs, rebuild
   the clause.
3. Repair moves, in order of frequency:
   - split one overloaded sentence into two or three, with full stops
   - restore elided subjects and prepositions (who, from where, toward
     what)
   - unstack modifier clauses piled before a noun; drop zero-information
     modifiers entirely
   - swap invented verb collocations for the ones people actually say
4. Re-read the repaired line aloud. Then check it against the freeze
   list — if the repair moved a beat, a function, or a voice marker,
   back up and repair again within the freeze.

## Generic spoken-grammar rules

Derived from real owner-repair precedents (2026-07-13); project-agnostic —
the examples below are neutral constructions, not any project's content. A
project's own STYLE_GUIDE spoken-grammar section (and its exemplar
library) takes precedence and may extend these.

1. **Subjects and prepositions may not be elided past what speech
   allows.** Speech says who, from where, toward what.「你把窗簾拉開
   往外看」cannot compress to「窗簾拉開看出去」— the latter is
   annotation ellipsis, not something a mouth produces.
2. **At most ONE modifier clause before a noun; drop it if it carries no
   information.**「你住的這間房」— the listener already lives there;
   zero information, front-heavy sentence. Just「你的房間」.
3. **One information focus per sentence.** Two foci → two sentences,
   split with a full stop — never commas and dashes stringing three
   things into one line.
4. **Verb-object collocations must be ones heard in daily speech.**
   「亮出」takes a physical object (亮劍、亮牌), never「亮出喜歡」.
   When unsure, use the plainest verb (說、講、給你看). Self-test: have
   you heard this verb-object pair in a real conversation? If not, it's
   invented.
5. **Every locale gets its own native reading.** en / ko / any shipped
   locale passes through the same read-aloud repair under THAT language's
   native-speaker grammar intuition — this pass is not a Chinese-only fix.
   A locale must not come out more explanatory or more compressed than
   the others.
6. **Chinese lines use almost no adverbs.** Treat removal as a 98/100-strength
   default, not an absolute ban or numeric quota. First delete or recast each
   adverb. Keep one only when every natural alternative would change the
   line's truth, negation, modality, scope, chronology, causal relation,
   required degree, idiom, or upstream-required voice. Emphasis, rhythm,
   atmosphere, polish, generic intensification, and habitual hedging are not
   reasons to keep one. Never create clipped or padded Chinese merely to pass
   this rule.

## The project exemplar library (the anchor)

Each project keeps its owner's repair precedents as paired lines
(original → repaired) in its OWN adapter — inside or beside the
STYLE_GUIDE spoken-grammar section (e.g. a「判例庫」subsection). Project
content never lives in this factory-side doc.

Before touching a line, the worker reads the project's ENTIRE exemplar
library aloud, pair by pair, and hears what changed. Rules are an
abstraction of the owner's ear; the exemplars ARE the ear.

**Exemplars are teaching data, NOT decreed content.** The worker derives
every repair itself from rules + exemplars. When a line under repair is
literally an exemplar's original, applying the exemplar reproduces the
owner's repair — that is the mechanism working, not authority being
copied. Never mark such repairs as "owner-decreed lines" in the output:
decreed lines exist only at the CREATIVE layer (a destination line a beat
sheet locks by design), never at the quality layer. An owner correction
enters the library and generalizes; it does not become a pasted quotation
with the owner's name on it.

A neutral illustration of what one exemplar pair teaches:

- original:「你住的這間房在走廊底——左邊是廚房，窗簾拉開看出去，就是山。」
- repaired:「你的房間在走廊底——左邊是廚房。你把窗簾拉開往外看，就是山。」

Same beat, same pragmatic function, same information, same voice. What
changed: one sentence became two, the elided subject and preposition came
back, the zero-information relative clause dropped. That is this craft's
entire scope.

## Output

1. The artifact with quoted lines revised in place (or, when the caller
   asks for a non-destructive dry-run, a copy at the caller-named path).
2. A fluency log at the caller-given path, containing:
   - one entry per changed line: original sentence → repaired sentence,
     plus ONE plain-language line stating the grammatical reason
     (e.g. "restored elided subject + split two foci") — this is what the
     review gate uses to verify the meaning was NOT changed;
   - a count of lines read and left unchanged;
   - honesty loop: end by naming the one or two repairs you are least
     confident about, so the next gate adjudicates them explicitly.
   - when a glossary exists: the mechanically extracted protected/banned
     forms, checker result, any speaker/register judgment, and any new-term
     `status=pending` nomination.

## Self-check before output

- Did I read every quoted line aloud, in every locale?
- Is every change syntactic — could someone diff the log and find a
  changed meaning, a moved beat, a softened function, a flattened voice?
  If yes, revert that change and repair within the freeze.
- Does every repaired line pass the project STYLE_GUIDE spoken-grammar
  rules (or the five generic rules above)?
- Does every changed line have its comparison entry in the log?

Never edit the sovereignty files (`WORLD_RULES.md`, `NARRATIVE_DELIVERY.md`,
or a legacy `WORKFLOW_CORE_VARIABLES.md`).
