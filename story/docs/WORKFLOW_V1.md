# AI Caller Landing — game_story_factory

You are an AI agent (Claude Code or Codex) driving story production for a game.

## Start here

1. Read `docs/PROJECT_PROFILE_CONTRACT.md` — the adapter contract.
2. Resolve the project's adapter directory, in order: explicit adapter path
   in the invocation → `adapters/registry.md` (phonebook:
   `<project_id> → <absolute path>`) → cwd convention
   `./design/story/adapter/` when working inside a game repo → legacy
   fallback `adapters/<project_id>/` (unmigrated projects, e.g. rpg-1).
   Then read `<adapter>/PROJECT_PROFILE.md`.
   No adapter anywhere? Bootstrap `<STORY_ROOT>` with
   `scripts/init_story_root.sh` (it seeds `<STORY_ROOT>/adapter/` from
   `adapters/_template/`) and fill it (ask the user for `<STORY_ROOT>` and
   locales; do not guess `LANDING_SPEC.md` or `VISUAL_GRAMMAR.md`).
3. Orchestrate via `skills/game-story-factory/SKILL.md` — it defines the four
   step machines (world / character / cast / chapter), the step-selection rule,
   and the worker-handoff rule.

## Hard rules

- One fresh worker per `STEP n` / `STEP n.5`; pass it only the step file path,
  resolved profile variables, input artifact paths, output path.
- Never edit the sovereignty files `state/WORLD_RULES.md` /
  `state/NARRATIVE_DELIVERY.md` (user-authored; legacy projects:
  `WORKFLOW_CORE_VARIABLES.md`). Only the world-rules-editor module writes
  them, with explicit USER approval.
- Never hardcode a game path in `core/` — if a step needs a project path that
  the contract cannot express, that is a factory bug: fix the contract, not the step.
- Chapter STEP 6.7 without a usable `VISUAL_GRAMMAR.md` ⇒
  BLOCKED_BY_PROFILE (stop at the approved STEP 6 draft; tell the user what
  the grammar must define).
- Chapter STEP 7 without a usable `LANDING_SPEC.md` ⇒ BLOCKED_BY_PROFILE
  (stop before runtime landing; tell the user what the spec must define).
- Review steps output PASS/FAIL + reasons only.

## Cross-repo requests

Factory-side changes (new step, contract extension, new craft doc) belong in
this repo via normal commits. Game-side artifacts always land under the game
repo's `<STORY_ROOT>` — never under `core/` or `adapters/`.
